# Maximum Parsimony Analysis
Python program for parsimony scoring of a given tree

* This program gives a phylogenetic tree and calculates the minimum number of mutations from root to the leaves.

## Input
- first line: n = number of nodes in the tree
- line 2, ..., n: i, j : shows that there is connection between node i and node j
- line n + 1: m = number of leaves
- line n+2, ..., n + m + 2: id of leaf and its value

## Output
minimum number of mutations
